- [If you haven't yet scheduled a 1:1 meeting with me, please do so!](https://michelle-cf.youcanbook.me/service/jsps/cal.jsp?cal=eb676149-9d65-4ce9-ab90-db85e04d5e08&ini=1575672232500&jumpDate=2019-12-09)
- This week's lab project will build quickly Mon-Weds, and then have a lighter day Thursday. Getting behind early in the week can make it hard to make progress later in the week, so as much as possible, make sure you're keeping on top of lab work!

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.

## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Assignments have been challenging, "frustrating but rewarding"
- Code review and pair programming
  - You've really appreciated learning from each other this week
  - that's AWESOME.
- Lab, working through assignments

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- Journal assignments
- Frustration working on assignments that aren't 100% things we've covered in class
  - It makes assignments harder, but is also preparing you for the future.
  - The 15 minute rule still applies: if you're trying to research something and not making progress, talk to us! We want to help you learn those research skills, too.

### Quotes of the Week

- Things happening in personal life and also starting at Code Fellows is "kind of like trying to hit a fast ball in a tornado"
- Most helpful this week: "Google"
