## Warmup Questions

Work with a partner to write down an answer to each of these questions. Please do NOT use your computer or any other resources to complete this warmup! This is a chance for you and your partner to test your understanding so far. These questions are a mix of review of class, and review of your reading.

1. What commands do we use to interact with git? What do they each do?
1. What data types have we used so far in JavaScript?
1. What is an array? What does it do?
