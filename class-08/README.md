# Class 8: HTML Forms and JS Events

## Announcements

- Please make sure you're sitting next to someone new today!
- Another hard day ahead of us today. We'll take our time with constructors in code review, and then build on it with forms & events.
- Slalom event at 12:15 today.

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 8 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to add an input form to an HTML document with properly structured HTML including the necessary `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<label>` tags, as well as the useful but not necessary `<fieldset>` tag, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate how to use JavaScript events with the .addEventListener() method on a DOM element (specifically, an HTML form), using either a named or anonymous event handler function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Be able to add a new row to their data table(s) by storing, computing, and rendering data from the HTML form, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
